## markdown-previewer challenge

### My version of [florinpop17 app ideas (Markdown Previewer)](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/GitHub-Profiles.md)

Solo project to further improve my React and Typescript skills!

- Use of ant.design components to aid my poor design skills

- The challenge proposes the following criteria:

  - User can enter Github flavored markdown into a textarea
  - User can see the resulting HTML updated automatically when the markdown textarea is changed
  - When closing the browser window the markdown formatted text will be stored in localStorage and when the User returns, the data will be retrieved and displayed
  - User can click a button and the content of the box is saved to the clipboard
